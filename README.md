**Techie Morsels**

Techie Morsels was a voluntary inter-company newsletter project.

In the mornings before I start to work, 
I check latest news on things such as software craftmanship , 
technology stacks, 

artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, products etc.
On one side there are breaking news and on the otherside there are  
slightly important but not much mentioned news or developments. 
I generally keep eye on those "not too much mentioned but quite interesting" 
ones.

This newsletter project was sharing those shareables like "hey, i've found 
this while reading news, look where this technology is going.." 
but not "hey, look at this stupid cat video" or video of 
"man bullying and getting his *ss kicked" :)
